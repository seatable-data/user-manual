# Group

You can divide the entire table into groups according to the value of a certain column. Click the "Group" button in the upper left corner of the interface. The pop-up box is shown in the following figure. There are two options:

* Column: You can select one of the columns that support grouping. SeaTable supports grouping of columns of numbers, text, dates, single selection, multiple selection, collaborator types.
* Up / Down: You can choose "Up" or "Down". Up will arrange then groups in ascending order, and Down will arrange the groups in descending order. The sorting rule for different types of columns is the same as the rule in sorting feature.

SeaTable only supports one grouping column. This is different from "filtering" and "sorting" which can set multiple conditions at the same time.
