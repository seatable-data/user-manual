# Sort

The purpose of sorting is to change the "unordered" data to "ordered" according to the specified sorting rules, so that users can browse and find the data in order.

Click the "Sort" button in the toolbar. The pop-up box is shown as in the following figure. There are two options: 

* Column: You can select one column that used for sorting. SeaTable supports sorting columns of numbers, texts, dates, single choices, and multiple choices. Other types of columns such as pictures, files, and long texts do not support sorting.
* Up / Down: You can choose "Up" or "Down". Up arrange data in ascending way, and Down arrange data in descending way.

## Sorting rules

Different types of columns have different rules for sorting.

* Numbers: Sort numbers by numerical value.
* Text: Sort in lexicographical order.
* Date: Sort in chronological order.
* Single / multiple selection: sort in the order of labels according to the list of labels of the column. You can rearrange the list of labels in the column options editing dialog.

## Multiple sorting rules

You can create multiple sorting rules. The first rule will be used first, if two items are equal using the first rule, then the second rule will be used, and so on.
