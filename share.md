# Share

We can share a table with others for multi-person collaboration. Below we introduce the sharing process.

First select "Share" from the drop-down menu for the table:

In the dialog, we can see two sharing methods, one is to directly enter the other's email address or name, and the other is to send a sharing link. If you use the first method, and your account is a personal account, then you need to know the other party's full email to select the other party's account. So the second way is recommended here.

We can generate a read-write shared link, and then sent to other people in the chat tool or via email. The other party clicks on this link and follows the instructions on the page to join the sharing of the table.

**The final effect of the two methods is equal.**
